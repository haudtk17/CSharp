------------------------------------
- C# have 2 kind of constructor:
	+ instance constructor
	+ static constructor
- static constructor always be called - called only one time - before any thing else(but after field initializing) when class is used.
If programmer do not define "static constructor", compiler will auto generate one, and as imagine all field will be assigned with value inside this static constructor.
If programmer explicitly define "static constructor", compiler will NOT generate one.

Follow that, instance constructor is called
ex:
	public class X{
		public int x = 9;	//this will be called #1
		public double y;	//this will also be called #1
		
	}

***one class can ONLY have 1 static constructor
***static constructor can not be called by code, only compiler can call
***static constructor is called by compiler to start any static member inside static constructor
***both static and non-static field is initialized before any non-constructor or static constructor is called:
	+, non-static field is initialized when new object
	+, static field is initialized when class is load at the first time
	flow of class: "class is first load" or "create new" ==> fields ==> constructor
explain more clearer:
If any static member is called first ==> static constructor is called first
If no static member is called first ==> static constructor will be called one time when create new instance of class
------------------------------------
- static constructor is only one in class. because compiler only know 1 static constructor to call
- static constructor is not have access modifier. because it is for compiler, not any code else call
- static constructor exists because it is intended to be used to initialize/load the initial data for class. This data usually is used as single load like: only one logger for the whole of program, only one configuration file,..etc
- inside static constructor may need use complex logic for initialize/load data for class
ex:
	public class Config{
		private static int x;
		private static Loger loger;
		public static Dictionary<string, string> Settings;		

		statics Config(){
			Settings = LoadConfigFromJson("config.json");
		}

		private static LoadConfigFromJson(string path){
			//handling load file
		}
	}
------------------------------------
- like C++, if no any instance constructor is defined ==> compiler will auto generate one default constructor with no parameter.
But if have at least one instance constructor ==> default instance constructor will not be generated by compiler
